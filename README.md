Backup Checker
==============

Set up your Akeeba Backup to email a Google mail account under component parameters. 
Set the email address so it can be filtered e.g. example@gmail.com can be example+site1@gmail.com.
This will still go to example@gmail.com but now you can automatically add labels based on the email address.

Setup a label in Google Mail and add an automatic filter based on the email address.

Add the files to a server and navigate to the file via a browser.

Fill out the settings and you're done.

Make sure the folder the script is in, is writeable because it needs to save a settings file.
